# Linear Regression using Normal Equation
Using Ice-cream Revenue-Temperature data to create Linear Regression Model using Normal Equation

## Dataset 
Ice-cream Revenue v/s Temperature from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vinicius150987/ice-cream-revenue)

## Project Highlights
This project was developed in order to have hands-on experience on how Linear Algorithm works. Using the data a Linear Regression model is created with Normal Equation that predicts the Revenue of Ice Cream at a given Temperature. After developing the model, R2 Scoring was used to evaluate the model, and turns out the model predicted with `0.978936444541632` accuracy.
